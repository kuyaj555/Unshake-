        <p><strong>Youth Camp 2025 — UNSHAKEN!</strong> For 3 amazing days, we experienced the joy of being together as a group, making memories and building friendships that will last a lifetime. The games brought out our competitive spirit, but the most powerful part was the time we spent encountering God. It wasn’t just about fun; it was about feeling His presence in every moment and in each other's lives. Through worship, reflection, and fellowship, we grew closer to God and to one another. As Hebrews 12:28 says, 'Since we are receiving a Kingdom that is unshakable, let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe.' Our hearts were stirred, and our faith was truly unshaken. It was more than just a camp—it was a life-changing experience!</p>
